# writer-resume
It is my resume, created for a content writing position, freelance or otherwise, created in HTML.

##What's the point of this?

I needed a resume for a position of a writer, freelance or otherwise. I wanted to create an online resume since forever. So I decided, why not?

I do have offline copies in docx and PDF forms, no matter how much I hate the latter.
